        <h1> Grassroots Volunteer Oppurtunities</h1>
          <p>We feel “Charity” is not the solution to Africa’s problems, instead we support a socio-economic rebalancing, helping people free themselves from the oppressive economic state they are in. Our volunteer opportunities aim at working on a Grass Roots level with the individuals in our community, helping alleviate their struggle for health care, education and a reasonable standard of living.</p>
          <p>We aim to strengthen our community from within, through a combination of financial support, voluntary work and other resources. Like our Facebook page Roots Yard Ghana for updates.</p>
        <h1>Individual Volunteer Oppurtunities</h1>
          <p>Fulfilling volunteer projects for individuals who like an adventure and are keen to work closely with the local community</p>
        <h3> Program 1: Teaching Assistant</h3>
          <p>We are working with a local primary and JSS School with nursery/ Kindergarten classes attached. The volunteers in this program will be working alongside the Ghanaian teachers, helping to support and encourage a more child-centered, creative educational approach lesson structure.</p>
        <h3> Program 2: School Building Project</h3>
          <p>We are helping the school build the classroom block for their nursery/ Kindergarten pupils. With the walls up, we have been able to complete the roof. However, there is so much more to do; the windows, the floor, plastering the walls, guttering and rain-harvest tanks, chalk-boards, desks & chairs etc. With the funds that you bring to the project the volunteers in the program will be working directly with the carpenters, plumbers, masons etc., getting involved with the manual labour & seeing exactly where your donation money is going.</p>
        <h3>Program 3: Sports Projects</h3>
          <p>Depending on your indicidual skills/ interests, you can offer your assistance to any part of the Sports related projects. Football enthusiasts can help the Youth Football Team, organising Soccer practive and Fitness Training.</p>
          <p>We have also built a skate park</p>
        <h4>Roots Rebel SK8 Park</h4>
            <p>Any skateboarders will be welcome to come and share their skills and enthusiam with our growing skate community. We are always in need of old skateboards or spare parts, skate shoes or clothing!</p>
            <p>As a sports volunteer your donation money will go towards supplying the teams with training kits & 'match strips', boots, balls, skateboards, pads etc. and you will be getting involved in our organising local sports matches/ skate competitions.</p>
