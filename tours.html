        There are also a number of interesting Cultural and Historical things to see in and around Peki itself. Peki is Historically very influentual. The migration of 
        the EWE from Dahomey (modern day Benin) in the 15th Century, due in part to the tyranical rule of King Agorkoli, the settlers in Peki empowered themselves as mediators 
        between the ruling Akwamu and other EWE states and towns. Peki was also an important town linking the trade in enslaved people from the interior to the costal Slave Markets 
        where they were exchanged for goods including salt. There are Caves in Peki where escaped slaves hid to evade re-capture.
